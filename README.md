Tempus is a fast-paced action game that launches players into the heat of battle in a beautiful, strange fantasy world. A century after the Timewalkers fell, Fluz wakes up to find themselves responsible for recovering the Timewalkersâ€™ most closely guarded secret in order to save them all. Players inhabit Fluz, a powerful avian Timewalker, who can shift at will between the past and the present. This allows players to evade dangers in one time or leverage weapons from the other, as they dash between two worlds to survive and ultimately rewrite the timeline.
